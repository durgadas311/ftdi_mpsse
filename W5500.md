# W5500
## WizNet W5500 Ethernet Controller
### Adafruit FeatherWing Module

Must be powered separately. Used a 3.3V 600mA Pololu connected to a 5V 500mA power supply.
Used C232HM-DDHSL (3.3V) but left the 3.3V (RED) wire disconnected.

Saw odd behavior if the C232HM-DDHSL delivered power to the WizNet module before
(or without) the external power supply.
The W5500 would get in a state where it could not link-up to the LAN -
Link LED would blink, immediately followed by activitly LED blink,
then a pause before repeating.
This seemed to be the switch trying to contact the WizNet module, but the module was
unable to respond (and establish the link).

When the external power supply was activated before connecting the C232HM-DDHSL to
the USB port, the WizNet module linked to the LAN (link LED on steady)
and functioned as expected (after configuring, could be ping'ed and make connections).
